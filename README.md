 YouTube UI Clone
 
Welcome to my YouTube clone project! This is a front-end focused build where I challenged myself to recreate the world’s most famous video platform using nothing but HTML5 and CSS3.
We use YouTube every day, but we rarely think about the intricate grid systems and flexbox layouts that keep it all together.
I built this to bridge the gap between being a user and being a creator. 
My goal was to see if I could replicate that iconic, clean Google aesthetic from scratch while keeping the code maintainable and organized.

Takeaways:
This project was less about "making a website" and more about understanding User Experience (UX). It taught me how to handle whitespace, how to manage large sets of imagery, and how to stay sane while nesting multiple div tags!
